## • A case study (region of interest): 
### Project of Establishment of Mobile GSMs to Mitigate the Effects of the 6 February Earthquake.

## • Aim and objectives:
The aim of this project is to identify and demonstrate suitable areas for the installation of mobile GSM base stations to replace damaged base stations in order to prevent communication disruptions caused by earthquakes as quickly as possible. 

The main objectives of the project are:
1. Identifying suitable areas for the installation of mobile GSM base stations to replace damaged base stations in order to prevent communication disruptions after an earthquake.
2. Installing and determining the locations of mobile GSM stations that can provide service.
3. Identifying suitable areas for the installation of mobile GSM stations in high-elevation areas.
4. Installing more frequent mobile GSM stations in areas where damage is intense.
5. Mapping the locations of mobile GSM base stations using QGIS after suitable areas are identified.
6. Collaborating with relevant institutions and companies to install mobile GSM base stations in suitable locations.
7. Planning and preparing for faster and more effective intervention to prevent communication disruptions after an earthquake.
8. Keeping the data obtained in the project accurate and up-to-date and sharing it with relevant institutions.
9. The goal of this project is to reduce communication interruptions after earthquakes and to quickly and effectively install and operate mobile GSM stations to meet people's communication needs.

## • Requirements:
**The requirements of this project are as follows:**
* Collecting, analyzing, and processing relevant data to identify suitable areas for the installation of mobile GSM base stations to prevent communication disruptions after an earthquake.
* Using mapping software such as QGIS to identify suitable areas and map the locations of mobile GSM base stations.
* Procuring the devices, equipment, power sources, and other materials required for the installation of mobile GSM base stations.
* Determining the technical specifications of the mobile GSM base stations to be installed and using devices that meet these specifications.
* Taking necessary measures for environmental compatibility of the mobile GSM base stations to be installed.
* Taking necessary security measures and implementing protection measures for the safety of mobile GSM base stations.
* Ensuring project financing and budget planning.
* Sharing the project with relevant institutions, companies, and local people and obtaining their approval.
* Monitoring the progress of the project and reporting the results.
* Conducting necessary planning and management activities to ensure the sustainability of the project.
